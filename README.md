Learning concepts:
- React component-based development
- Managing object state by utilising React's **_useState_** hook
- Passing properties on parent to child component through **_props_**
- Utilising **_array.map_** function to dynamically define multiple component instances, and spread **_props_** on each component instance
- Wrapping multiple UI elements in a fragment on return (when appropriate)
- Elevating object state to the parent component when multiple sibling components require information on the object state
- Forwarding **_props_** to wrapped element
- Utilising **_props.children_** to retrieve nested UI elements
- Utilising **_props.something_** to store chunks of html code (UI elements), similar to the capability of **_props.children_**
